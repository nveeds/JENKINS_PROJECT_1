Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate various aspects of software development, including building, testing, and deploying software. It is a widely used tool in the field of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

With Jenkins, you can create automated workflows called "jobs" or "builds" that define the steps and actions required to build and deploy your software projects. These jobs can be triggered manually or automatically based on certain events, such as code changes in a version control system.

Some key features of Jenkins include:

Continuous Integration (CI): Jenkins allows developers to integrate their code changes frequently, ensuring that the software builds successfully and that any issues are detected early in the development process.

Extensibility: Jenkins has a large number of plugins available, which allow you to extend its functionality and integrate with various tools and technologies. These plugins provide support for things like version control systems, testing frameworks, deployment tools, and more.

Distributed Builds: Jenkins can distribute the build and test workloads across multiple machines, allowing for faster and more efficient execution of jobs.

Build Pipelines: Jenkins supports the creation of complex build pipelines, where multiple jobs can be connected together to form a sequence of steps. This enables advanced workflows and allows for more sophisticated deployment strategies.

Community and Ecosystem: Jenkins has a vibrant community of users and contributors, which means there is a wealth of resources, documentation, and support available. You can find a wide range of plugins and integrations developed by the community.

Jenkins can be installed on a server or run as a Docker container, and it provides a web-based interface for managing and configuring jobs. It supports various operating systems and integrates with popular version control systems like Git.
